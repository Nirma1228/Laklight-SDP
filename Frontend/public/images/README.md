# Product Images

## How to Add Your Product Images

The React app is configured to use images from this folder. To add your product images:

1. **Save the images you uploaded to this folder with these exact names:**
   - `Wood Apple Juice.png` - Wood Apple nectar bottle
   - `Mango Jelly.png` - Mango jelly box
   - `Logo.png` - Laklights logo
   - `Lime Mix.png` - Lime mix bottle
   - `Custard powder.png` - Custard powder box

2. **The images are already referenced in these components:**
   - CustomerDashboard.jsx (product catalog with cart)
   - ProductCatalog.jsx (admin product management)
   - Header.jsx (logo in navigation)
   - AdminDashboard.jsx (logo)
   - EmployeeDashboard.jsx (logo)

3. **Current image paths in the code:**
   - `/images/Lime Mix.png`
   - `/images/Wood Apple Juice.png`
   - `/images/Mango Jelly.png`
   - `/images/Custard powder.png`
   - `/images/Logo.png`

## Where Images Appear

- **Home page** - Logo in header
- **Product Catalog** - Product cards with images
- **Customer Dashboard** - Featured products section with images
- **All dashboards** - Logo in header navigation

Once you save the actual image files in this folder, they will automatically appear in the UI!
